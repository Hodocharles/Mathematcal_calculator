Project set to calculate differential equations, simplify algebraic expression and perform newton Raphson Method 
This project is dedicated to God and AFIT 100 and 200 Level Students (Department of Mathematics and Statistics).
It is also dedicated to My lecturers Mr. Aliyu, Mr. Rupert and Badmus who taught me and answered my questions in a manner that expands my knowledge 

The project here contains the Newton-Raphson Algorithm made in Python as a personal project.

Explanation
In numerical analysis, the Newton's Method (or Method of Newton-Raphson), developed by Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, aims at estimating the roots of a function. For this purpose, an initial approximation is chosen, after this, the equation of the tangent line of the function at this point and the intersection of it with the axis of the abscissa, in order to find a better approximation for the root, is calculated. By repeating the process, an iterative method is created to find the root of the function.

In mathematical notation the method is described in the following formula:


x(n+1)=x(n)-f(xn)/f'(xn)
